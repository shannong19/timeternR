 abstract = {Many models for the spread of infectious diseases in populations have been analyzed mathematically and applied to specific diseases. Threshold theorems involving the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub>, the contact number σ, and the replacement number R are reviewed for the classic SIR epidemic and endemic models. Similar results with new expressions for R<sub>0</sub> are obtained for MSEIR and SEIR endemic models with either continuous age or age groups. Values of R<sub>0</sub> and σ are estimated for various diseases including measles in Niger and pertussis in the United States. Previous models with age structure, heterogeneity, and spatial structure are surveyed.},

abstract="Mathematical models have become important tools in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases. Although chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease receive more attention in developed countries, infectious diseases are the most important causes of suffering and mortality in developing countries. Recently, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is the etiological agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), has become an important sexually-transmitted disease throughout the world. Tuberculosis is again becoming a problem because drug-resistant strains have evolved. Understanding the transmission characteristics of infectious diseases in communities, regions and countries can lead to better approaches to decreasing the transmission of these diseases. Mathematical models are useful in building and testing theories, and in comparing, planning, implementing and evaluating various detection, prevention, therapy and control programs.

    abstract = {Agent-based models are a tool that can be used to better understand the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak. An infectious disease outbreak is influenced by many factors including vaccination or immunity levels, population density, and the age structure of the population. We hypothesize that these factors along with interactions of factors and the actions of individuals would lead to outbreaks of different size and severity even in two towns that appear similar on paper. Thus, it is necessary to implement a model that is able to capture these interactions and the actions of individuals. Using openly available data we create a data-driven agent-based model to simulate the spread of an airborne infectious disease in an Irish town. Agent-based models have been known to produce results that include the emergence of patterns and behaviours that are not directly programmed into the model. Our model is tested by simulating an outbreak of measles that occurred in Schull, Ireland in 2012. We simulate the same outbreak in 33 different towns and look at the correlations between the model results and the town characteristics (population, area, vaccination rates, age structure) to determine if the results of the model are affected by interactions of those town characteristics and the decisions on the agents in the model. As expected our results show that the outbreaks are not strongly correlated with any of the main characteristics of the towns and thus the model is most likely capturing such interactions and the agent-based model is successful in capturing the differences in the outbreaks.},

	abstract = {The reproduction number, , defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case, is a crucial quantity for identifying the intensity of interventions required to control an epidemic. Current estimates of the reproduction number for seasonal influenza show wide variation and, in particular, uncertainty bounds for for the pandemic strain from 1918 to 1919 have been obtained only in a few recent studies and are yet to be fully clarified. Here, we estimate using daily case notifications during the autumn wave of the influenza pandemic (Spanish flu) in the city of San Francisco, California, from 1918 to 1919. In order to elucidate the effects from adopting different estimation approaches, four different methods are used: estimation of using the early exponential-growth rate (Method 1), a simple susceptible{\textendash}exposed{\textendash}infectious{\textendash}recovered (SEIR) model (Method 2), a more complex SEIR-type model that accounts for asymptomatic and hospitalized cases (Method 3), and a stochastic susceptible{\textendash}infectious{\textendash}removed (SIR) with Bayesian estimation (Method 4) that determines the effective reproduction number at a given time t. The first three methods fit the initial exponential-growth phase of the epidemic, which was explicitly determined by the goodness-of-fit test. Moreover, Method 3 was also fitted to the whole epidemic curve. Whereas the values of obtained using the first three methods based on the initial growth phase were estimated to be 2.98 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.73, 3.25), 2.38 (2.16, 2.60) and 2.20 (1.55, 2.84), the third method with the entire epidemic curve yielded a value of 3.53 (3.45, 3.62). This larger value could be an overestimate since the goodness-of-fit to the initial exponential phase worsened when we fitted the model to the entire epidemic curve, and because the model is established as an autonomous system without time-varying assumptions. These estimates were shown to be robust to parameter uncertainties, but the theoretical exponential-growth approximation (Method 1) shows wide uncertainty. Method 4 provided a maximum-likelihood effective reproduction number 2.10 (1.21, 2.95) using the first 17 epidemic days, which is consistent with estimates obtained from the other methods and an estimate of 2.36 (2.07, 2.65) for the entire autumn wave. We conclude that the reproduction number for pandemic influenza (Spanish flu) at the city level can be robustly assessed to lie in the range of 2.0{\textendash}3.0, in broad agreement with previous estimates using distinct data.},

abstract = {Hurricanes and, more generally, tropical cyclones (TCs) are rare, complex natural phenomena of both scientific and public interest. The importance of understanding TCs in a changing climate has increased as recent TCs have had devastating impacts on human lives and communities. Moreover, good prediction and understanding about the complex nature of TCs can mitigate some of these human and property losses. Though TCs have been studied from many different angles, more work is needed from a statistical approach of providing prediction regions. The current state-of-the-art in TC prediction bands comes from the National Hurricane Center of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), whose proprietary model provides "cones of uncertainty" for TCs through an analysis of historical forecast errors. The contribution of this paper is twofold. We introduce a new pipeline that encourages transparent and adaptable prediction band development by streamlining cyclone track simulation and prediction band generation. We also provide updates to existing models and novel statistical methodologies in both areas of the pipeline, respectively.},

By using the exact solution we investigate some explicit models corresponding to fixed values of the parameters, and show that the numerical solution reproduces exactly the analytical solution. We also show that the generalization of the SIR model, including births and deaths, described by a nonlinear system of differential equations, can be reduced to an Abel type equation. The reduction of the complex SIR model with vital dynamics to an Abel type equation can greatly simplify the analysis of its properties. The general solution of the Abel equation is obtained by using a perturbative approach, in a power series form, and it is shown that the general solution of the SIR model with vital dynamics can be represented in an exact parametric form. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period. We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3-3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95{\%} CI 3.8-8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.},

abstract = {The statistical analysis of functional data is a growing need in many research areas. In particular, a robust methodology is important to study curves, which are the output of many experiments in applied statistics. As a starting point for this robust analysis, we propose, analyze, and apply a new definition of depth for functional observations based on the graphic representation of the curves. Given a collection of functions, it establishes the "centrality" of an observation and provides a natural center-outward ordering of the sample curves. Robust statistics, such as the median function or a trimmed mean function, can be defined from this depth definition. Its finite-dimensional version provides a new depth for multivariate data that is computationally feasible and useful for studying high-dimensional observations. Thus, this new depth is also suitable for complex observations such as microarray data, images, and those arising in some recent marketing and financial studies. Natural properties of these new concepts are established and the uniform consistency of the sample depth is proved. Simulation results show that the corresponding depth based trimmed mean presents better performance than other possible location estimators proposed in the literature for some contaminated models. Data depth can be also used to screen for outliers. The ability of the new notions of depth to detect "shape" outliers is presented. Several real datasets are considered to illustrate this new concept of depth, including applications to microarray observations, weather data, and growth curves. Finally, through this depth, we generalize to functions the Wilcoxon rank sum test. It allows testing whether two groups of curves come from the same population. This functional rank test when applied to children growth curves shows different growth patterns for boys and girls. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Statistical Association.},
annote = {This article presents 2 "band" depth-based approaches for 1d functional data. They claim to show that central bands are robust (like a median) using simulation (I gather the induce different types of pertibuations and show the bands don't really change that much. I'm not sure that's super useful).

Definitions of centrality:

1. (Section 2): 
Defn(a): let B(x1,...,xk) = the band that contains all points (t,r) such that min xi(t) {\textless} y {\textless} max xi(t)
Defn(b): Let (Band depth{\_}j) BD{\_}n{\^{}}(j)(x) = proportion of number of bands with j functions that contain x.
Defn(c): Let (Band depth{\_}J) BD{\_}n,J(x) = sum{\_}{\{}j =1{\}}{\^{}}J BD{\_}n{\^{}}(j)(x) --- **very similar to Simplexical Depth by Liu**.

* Proposed only using J = 3 for computation reasons* 
{\#}{\#} Aside: does this mirror Geenen's triangular inequality?


2. (Section 5: supposed to be better)
basically does the above, but changes BD{\_}n{\^{}}(j)(x) to MBD{\_}n{\^{}}(j)(x), where the later sums the proportion of time a function is contained in each specific band -this is easy to do with functions defined relative to finite steps.

suggests that BD focuses more on similarity of structure of curves whereas the MBD focuses less on this.

Other comments:
(Section 3.1) Claims this depth meets all properties from Zuo {\&} Serfling except affine invariance (and suggests this is not a natural requirement for functional depth)

Another comment: different measures deal with noise different


FUTURE WORK:
1. This could be compared with the distance based depth (Geenen): specific - how do these bands of 3 curves relate to the triangle inequality structure proposed by Greenen? And how would it relative to just 2 curves?
2. Think about global depth and centrality in the lense of robustness? How to think about local depth? Vs density estimates?
3. follow up on Cuevas, Febrero, and Fraiman's ‘Robust Estimation and Classification for Functional Data via Projection-Based Depth Notions' - as it relates to the density vs depth debate},

A range of modern statistical methods for POMP models have been implemented in this framework including sequential Monte Carlo, iterated filtering, particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, approximate Bayesian computation, maximum synthetic likelihood estimation, nonlinear forecasting, and trajectory matching. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of these methodologies using some simple toy problems. We also illustrate the specification of more complex POMP models, using a nonlinear epidemiological model with a discrete population, seasonality, and extra-demographic stochasticity. We discuss the specification of user-defined models and the development of additional methods within the programming environment provided by pomp.},

In particular, three factors are considered: the spatial location of an individual's home and the household and school class to which the individual belongs. The model is applied to an extremely informative measles data set and the model is compared with nested models, which incorporate some, but not all, of the aforementioned factors. A reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is then introduced which assists in selecting the most appropriate model to fit the data. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

@article{Gallagher2018,
abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate interactions between autonomous agents in constrained environments over time and are often used for modeling the spread of infectious diseases. ABMs use information about agents and their environments as input, together referred to as a “synthetic ecosystem.” Previous approaches for generating synthetic ecosystems have some limitations: they are not open-source, cannot be adapted to new or updated input data sources, or do not allow for alternative methods for sampling agent characteristics and locations. We introduce a general framework for generating synthetic ecosystems, called “Synthetic Populations and Ecosystems of the World” (SPEW). SPEW lets researchers choose from a variety of sampling methods for agent characteristics and locations and is implemented as an open-source R package. We analyze the accuracy and computational efficiency of SPEW, given different sampling methods for agent characteristics and locations, and provide a suite of statistical and graphical tools to screen our generated ecosystems. SPEW has generated over five billion human agents across approximately 100,000 geographic regions in over 70 countries available online.},

abstract = {Local depth is a generalization of ordinary depth able to reveal local features of the probability distribution. Liu's simplicial depth is primarily used, but results for Tukey's halfspace depth are also derived. It is shown that the maximizers of local depth can help to detect the mode(s) of a probability distribution. This work is devoted to the univariate case, but the main definitions are stated in the general multivariate case. Theoretical results and applications are illustrated with several examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
annote = {This paper proposes 2 local depth that switches the definitions of the global depths they update in such a ways the the geometry changes are pretty clean.

Local depth definitions:
1. Local simplicial depth (t is tuning): 
ld{\_}s(x, t) = Proportion of simplicials of size p that contain x (p should be at least d + 1 - where d is size of space) *is the extension of this actually check the triangle inequality and see if the max distance is below tau?*

2. Local halfspace depth:
d{\_}hs: halfspace is converted into slabs. then same definition is applied

In 4.1 they have some examples but also discuss some quick ways one might tune tau (specifically using the distribution of |X{\_}1 - X{\_}2| (in 1d space)

- example (22) shows that - with too small a selection of tau, you gets a high number of patial maximum ("local") - think about how to avoid it?

- proposed examining |x{\_}1 - x{\_}2| distribution (For 1d) to select tau.
* could we provide analysis to how tau is "just right"? (min should probably be our $\backslash$delta

- also mentioned a way to test if a point is a mode (this is depend on tau {\&} it seems to have the reverse null hypothesis then as desired) - not sure this is need to be extended -but if there was a way to think about H{\_}t,n as a function of tau we might be able to better capture tau. 

- I don't think tau really needs to go to zero as n-{\textgreater} infinite. Does this match with KDEs?},

@misc{Geenens2017,
abstract = {The concept of depth has proved very important for multivariate and functional data analysis, as it essentially acts as a surrogate for the notion a ranking of observations which is absent in more than one dimension. Yet, naive attempts to extend to the functional context some succesful multivariate depth measures have been seen to lead to absurd results, as they failed to take into acount in their construction purely functional features such as continuity, smoothness and contiguity. In this paper we suggest a natural depth which satisfies all the properties that a valid functional depth measure should fulfill. It is explicitly constructed on a certain distance d between functional objects, which has to be selected by the analyst. This allows the depth measure to really be tailored to the data at hand and to the ultimate goal of the analysis, a very desirable property in functional data analysis given the polymorphic nature of those data. This flexibility is thoroughly illustrated by several real data analyses, including an original one pertaining to the field of Symbolic Data Analysis},

@article{Biggerstaff2016,
abstract = {Background: Early insights into the timing of the start, peak, and intensity of the influenza season could be useful in planning influenza prevention and control activities. To encourage development and innovation in influenza forecasting, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) organized a challenge to predict the 2013-14 Unites States influenza season. Methods: Challenge contestants were asked to forecast the start, peak, and intensity of the 2013-2014 influenza season at the national level and at any or all Health and Human Services (HHS) region level(s). The challenge ran from December 1, 2013-March 27, 2014; contestants were required to submit 9 biweekly forecasts at the national level to be eligible. The selection of the winner was based on expert evaluation of the methodology used to make the prediction and the accuracy of the prediction as judged against the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). Results: Nine teams submitted 13 forecasts for all required milestones. The first forecast was due on December 2, 2013; 3/13 forecasts received correctly predicted the start of the influenza season within one week, 1/13 predicted the peak within 1 week, 3/13 predicted the peak ILINet percentage within 1 {\%}, and 4/13 predicted the season duration within 1 week. For the prediction due on December 19, 2013, the number of forecasts that correctly forecasted the peak week increased to 2/13, the peak percentage to 6/13, and the duration of the season to 6/13. As the season progressed, the forecasts became more stable and were closer to the season milestones. Conclusion: Forecasting has become technically feasible, but further efforts are needed to improve forecast accuracy so that policy makers can reliably use these predictions. CDC and challenge contestants plan to build upon the methods developed during this contest to improve the accuracy of influenza forecasts.},

We provide an algorithm to idenify significant local modes of the estimated pseudo-density, which are associated to informative sample clusters, and we prove its consistency and other statistical properties. Our theory is developed under weak assumptions, which essentially reduce to the integrability of the random curves. If the underlying probability distribution is supported on a finitedimensional subspace, we show that the proposed pseudo-density functional and the expectation of a kernel density estimator induce the same gradient flow, hence the same population clustering. Although our theory is developed for smooth curves that belong to a potentially infinite-dimensional functional space, we provide consistent procedures that can be used with real functional data (discretized and noisy curves). We illustrate these procedures by means of applications both on simulated and real datasets.},
